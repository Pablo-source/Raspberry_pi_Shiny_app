# Raspberry_pi_Shiny_app
This project will include all the materials used in the **19th January 2022** Webinar for the **NHS-R Community**

Designing a Shiny dashboard using a Raspberry Pi cluster

- This presentation describes the steps required to setup a Raspberry Pi cluster and preparations needed to turn it into a Shiny Server

In the NHS-R Community Webinar on Wednesday 19th, the presentation will cover these four topics: 

1. Different ways of connecting remotely to the Raspberry Pi
2. How to setup a Raspberry pi cluster, 
3. Generate a SSH key on Windows to log into each Raspberry Pi's in the Cluster
4. Briefly description of the process to create a Shiny server (following R Studio Community blog posts)

- Online resources used to build the presentation 

1.Generate SSH Keys on Windows and copy them to your Raspberry Pi cluster

This is the main blog post that details the steps required to setup a Shiny server on a Raspberry pi.

1.Main website that inspired this experiment

For this experimental project I followed  the post below from Andres Castro Socolich from the R studio community
https://community.rstudio.com/t/setting-up-your-own-shiny-server-rstudio-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-3b/18982

Preparing the Raspberry Pi

1. Install Raspbian OS
2. Set a static IP for our raspberry pi
3. Setting up the Server
3.1 We will use an HTML server, he uses Nginx 
3.2 Install Nginx 
4. Then we need a sql server for storing and manipulating our data
4.1 Install PostgreSQL it is open-source 
4.2 Configure postgresql to accept local and remote connections
4.3 Restart postgresql service
5. Install the latest version of R from source
6. Install Shiny-Server
7. Configure Shiny-Server
8. Install R Studio from source
9. Extra steps
10. Make pretty URLs for Shiny and Rstudio Server
11. To access you shiny app from anywehere over the internet, create a static public IP

This is an experimental project to test how it would be posible to run a Shiny app 24/7 from a Server setup in a Raspberry Pi cluster, an inexpensive way of designing a Shiny web app that people can access over the internet. 

All the credits and original ideas goes to the original developers of the different resources I have used to put together the required materials for this project.
